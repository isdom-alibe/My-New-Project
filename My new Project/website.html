        Algebra:The Language of Variables
    </h1>
    <p>Algebra introduces variablesâ€”letters like xx and yy
    that represent numbers. <br>It's like solving puzzles by
    finding the values of these variables. <br>From basic
    equations like x+5=12x+5=12 to more complex quadratic 
    equations,<br> algebra teaches us how to represent and 
    solve problems abstractly.</p>

    <h1 title="Calculus: Understanding Change" class="head-three">Calculus: Understanding Change</h1>
    <p>Calculus focuses on change and motion. 
    It's divided into differential calculus,<br> 
    which deals with rates of change (like speed), 
    and integral calculus, which deals<br> with accumulation
    (like area under a curve). Calculus is essential for
    understanding<br> complex systems, from physics to economics.</p>
    
    <h1 title="Geometry: Shapes and Spaces" class="head-four">Geometry: Shapes and Spaces</h1>
    <p>Geometry studies shapes, sizes, and the properties of 
    space. It covers everything from<br> simple shapes like 
    triangles and circles to complex forms and spaces.<br> 
    By learning about angles, area, and volume, geometry
    helps us understand<br> the structure of the world around us</p>

    <p>Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing,
     and interpreting data.<br> Through concepts like mean, 
     median, mode, and standard deviation,<br> statistics 
     helps us make informed decisions and predictions 
     based on<br> data, from scientific research to daily life.</p>
